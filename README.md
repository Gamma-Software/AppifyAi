# ü§ñ GenerativeApp
Use LLM's to dynamically update the existing Streamlit App.

## Demo

TODO

## Features

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): The chatbot utilizes NLP techniques to understand and interpret user instructions.
- Conversation Flow: The chatbot follows a well-defined conversational flow to interact with users and gather instructions.
- Code Generation: The chatbot dynamically generates Python code snippets based on user instructions.
- Streamlit Integration: The generated code is incorporated into a Streamlit application, providing an interactive web interface.
- Code Explanation: The chatbot provides detailed explanations of the generated code to help users understand its functionality.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it ! You are ready to go !

### Usage

1. Add you own OpenAI API key, by renaming the file `.streamlit/secrets_template.toml` to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and add your own API key in the following line:
```toml
openai_api_key = "your key here"
````

2. Then run the following command to start the app:

```shell
streamlit run generative_app/üè†StreamlitBot.py
```

3. Interact with the bot to generate the Streamlit App of your dreams !

## Usage Examples

Here are some example instructions you can provide to the chatbot:

    "Create a bar chart showing the sales data for the last quarter given earlier."
    "Generate a scatter plot with the temperature and humidity data given earlier."
    "Add a sidebar to the application with a dropdown menu for selecting options ("update", "save", "reset")."

The chatbot will interpret these instructions, generate the corresponding Python code, and create a Streamlit application accordingly in the page ü§ñGeneratedApp.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add a chatbot
- [x] Add a sandbox page for the bot to play with
- [x] Add commands to /undo, /reset, /save
- [ ] Embed in vector stores the up to dat documentation of Streamlit https://github.com/streamlit/docs/tree/main/content
- [ ] Add a voice assistant (text to speech and speech to text)
- [ ] Add a page to show the documentation of the app

The inital idea came after frustruation of not being able to correctly communicate with an robot assistant by phone. ChatGPT's power combined to Langchain with the toolset the thinking capabilities was the solution to this problem.
