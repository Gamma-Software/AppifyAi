## Features

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): The chatbot utilizes NLP techniques to understand and interpret user instructions.
- Conversation Flow: The chatbot follows a well-defined conversational flow to interact with users and gather instructions.
- Code Generation: The chatbot dynamically generates Python code snippets based on user instructions.
- Streamlit Integration: The generated code is incorporated into a Streamlit application, providing an interactive web interface.
- Code Explanation: The chatbot provides detailed explanations of the generated code to help users understand its functionality.

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it ! You are ready to go !

### Usage

1. Add you own OpenAI API key, by renaming the file `.streamlit/secrets_template.toml` to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and add your own API key in the following line:
```toml
openai_api_key = "your key here"
````

2. Then run the following command to start the app:

```shell
streamlit run generative_app/üè†ChatbotX.py
```

3. Interact with the bot to generate the Streamlit App of your dreams !

## Usage Examples

Here are some example instructions you can provide to the chatbot:

    "Create a bar chart showing the sales data for the last quarter given earlier."
    "Generate a scatter plot with the temperature and humidity data given earlier."
    "Add a sidebar to the application with a dropdown menu for selecting options ("update", "save", "reset")."

The chatbot will interpret these instructions, generate the corresponding Python code, and create a Streamlit application accordingly in the page ü§ñGeneratedApp.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add a chatbot
- [x] Add a sandbox page for the bot to play with
- [x] Add commands to /undo, /reset, /save
- [ ] Embed in vector stores the up to dat documentation of Streamlit https://github.com/streamlit/docs/tree/main/content
- [ ] Add a voice assistant (text to speech and speech to text)
- [ ] Add a page to show the documentation of the app
