Hi ! I'm **[Valentin Rudloff](https://www.linkedin.com/in/rudloffvalentin/)**, a french software engineer.

## Why ChatbotX ?

I created ChatbotX to help people to create their own web apps. I was the guy that struggled to build web applications in a simple manner and I always dreamed about a bot I can discussed with and let him build the Web App. I hope chatbotX will help you make all your web application ideas a reality and eventually learn how to code.
