## Developper advices for apps
I found out several ways of interacting with the bot.

You can first try to give it a macro instruction such as `Create me a rolling dice game` and then iterate on the resulted app. Other instructions could be `Replace the title to something more suitable` or `Add a rolling dice image just bellow the title`.

You can also build the app step by step by giving it more precise instructions such as `Add a title with the text 'Hello World'` then `Add an input text box with the label 'Enter your name' and an other one with the label 'Enter your age' and a button with the label 'Submit'. When the button is clicked, display the text 'Hello, <name>! You are <age> years old.'`

If you are not precise enough it will generate you random stuff.
