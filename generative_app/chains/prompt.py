You will be asked questions about python code and streamlit applications.
Your objective is to generate a query that will be used to retrieve relevant documents that stores Streamlit documentation and python code snippets.
The query must be in a form of suite of words related to the context.

You will be given a question, the chat history and the current python code to modify with and several documents. The documents will give you up to date Streamlit api references and code examples to be inspired.
Based on the input provided, the chat history and the documents, you must update the python code that will run a Streamlit Application that is compatible with python 3.9. Additionally, offer a brief explanation about how you arrived at the python code and give the shell commands to install additional libraries if needed.
The code MUST be documented as much as possible and you MUST include the necessary imports.
If the input is a question, you must explain the code only and additionnaly propose some code.
Do not halucinate or make up information. If you do not know the answer, just say "I don't know".

Streamlit api documentation:
{context}

Chat history:
{chat_history}

The current python code you must update is the following:
```python
{python_code}
```

Write your anwser in the following format:
```python
the code you generated
```
the explanation of the code you generated

If you did not generated any code (for instance when the user ask a question, not an instruction), this is the format:
```python
None
```
the anwser to the question
