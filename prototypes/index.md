## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

What things you need to install the software and how to install them

```shell
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it ! You are ready to go !

### Running the app

1. Add you own OpenAI API key, by renaming the file `.streamlit/secrets_template.toml` to `.streamlit/secrets.toml` and add your own API key in the following line:
```toml
openai_api_key = "your key here"
````

2. Then run the following command to start the app:

```shell
streamlit run generative_app/üè†ChatbotX.py
```

3. Interact with the bot to generate the Streamlit App of your dreams !

### Usage

This is a **chatbot**, simply enter your instruction and it will generate the corresponding Python code and create a Streamlit Web app application accordingly. To see it in action go to the page ü§ñGeneratedApp.

It understand the context and remembers what you said before. For example, if you ask the bot the following instructions in order:
1. "add a title with the text 'Hello World'"
2. "replace the title with the text 'Hello World, this is my first Streamlit application'"
3. "replace the title with a subtitle and the same text"
You will end up with a Streamlit application with a subtitle with the text 'Hello World, this is my first Streamlit application'.

#### Commands

If you want to reset the context, you can use the command `/reset` or `/undo` to undo the last action. You can also use `/save` to save the current generated app and download the script.

#### Usage Examples

Tell ChatbotX the following instructions:

Simple instructions:
- "Add a title with the text 'Hello World' and a subtitle with the text 'This is my first Streamlit application'."
- "Add an input text box with the label 'Enter your name' and an other one with the label 'Enter your age' and a button with the label 'Submit'. When the button is clicked, display the text 'Hello, <name>! You are <age> years old.'"
- "Add a sidebar to the application with a dropdown menu for selecting options ("update", "save", "reset")."

Upload files and display charts:
- "Display the function f(x) = x^2 in a line chart for x in [-10, 10] and give the graph an adequat name."
- "Give the possibility to upload a csv file and display its content in a table after upload"
- "Give the possibility to upload a csv file and display a bar chart showing the data"
- "Give the possibility to upload a csv file store the data in a pandas dataframe to later display statistics then create a select box to select the column to display the statictics. Be creative and display whatever statictics you want"

Useful apps:
- "Ask to enter a first date and a second date input and display the number of days between them. Add a title and some explanation text accordingly before the date inputs."
- "Ask to enter a first date and a second date input and display the number of business days between them. Add a title and some explanation text accordingly before the date inputs."

Webscraping:
- "Webscrap this site (https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blog) and display all the 'mw-headline' classes"

Creating games:
- "Create me a rolling dice game"

Using open APIs:
- "Display me random cats pictures using open apis and add button to update the image"

The chatbot will interpret these instructions, generate the corresponding Python code, and create a Streamlit application accordingly in the page ü§ñGeneratedApp.

## Roadmap

- [x] Add a chatbot
- [x] Add a sandbox page for the bot to play with
- [x] Add commands to /undo, /reset, /save
- [ ] Embed in vector stores the up to date documentation of Streamlit https://github.com/streamlit/docs/tree/main/content and Langchain (and other libraries)
- [ ] Add a voice assistant (text to speech and speech to text)
- [ ] Add a page to show the documentation of the app
- [ ] Automate the installation of more libraries
- [ ] Check confusing instructions and give the chatbot the possibility to improve the instruction of the user and he will need to valide the new instruction.
